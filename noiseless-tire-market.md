<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noiseless Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noiseless tire market consists of two primary types: radial and bias tires. Radial tires feature a construction where the cords run perpendicular to the direction of travel, allowing for betterFlexibility, durability, and enhanced fuel efficiency. They typically produce less noise while rolling, contributing to a quieter ride. Bias tires, with their cords layered diagonally, tend to offer a stiffer ride and may generate more noise. However, they provide better stability under heavy loads, making them suitable for specific applications.</p></p>
