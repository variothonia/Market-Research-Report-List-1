<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knife Valves and Gate Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Knife Valve</li><li>Gate Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knife valves and gate valves are two distinct types of industrial valves used for controlling the flow of liquids and gases. Knife valves feature a sharp-edged blade that slices through the medium, ideal for handling slurries or viscous fluids, ensuring minimal blockage. In contrast, gate valves utilize a flat gate that raises or lowers to allow or obstruct flow, providing a tight seal and minimal pressure drop. Both valves serve crucial roles in various applications across sectors like oil and gas, water treatment, and chemical processing.</p></p>
