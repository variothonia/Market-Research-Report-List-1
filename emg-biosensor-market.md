<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EMG Biosensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Biosensors</li><li>Intramuscular Biosensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EMG biosensor market comprises primarily two types: surface biosensors and intramuscular biosensors. Surface biosensors are non-invasive devices that measure electrical activity from muscles through the skin, commonly used in rehabilitation and sports medicine. They are user-friendly and suitable for real-time monitoring. Intramuscular biosensors, in contrast, involve implantable or needle-based electrodes that provide precise readings of muscle activity directly from within the muscle tissue. These are often employed in clinical settings for detailed analysis and research applications.</p></p>
